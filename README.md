# Evaporative cooler calculator PWA

## What is it?
This is my first try at creating a progressive web application. I made a simple calulator application that takes weather details and gives you an estimate of how much an evaporative cooler will cool down the air.

1. [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/)
2. [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
